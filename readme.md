# Projects Display

This is a personal website aside my actual portfolio designed to display projects, experience, skills, and contact information in a resume format. The website is divided into two main sections: a profile section and a projects section. The profile section provides information about myself social links, and details about experience, skills, and contributions. The projects section showcases various projects with descriptions, skills used, and links to live demos or code repositories. The site also includes a contact form for potemtial clients to send messages.
